After picking up JavaScript a few months ago, this is my first standalone project that has been testing out the limits to my vanilla JS knowledge. [Link to source](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/Calculator){:target="_blank"}

In particular, building this calculator has been a necessary exercise in my self-teaching journey because it allowed me to confront the previously elusive concepts of DOM manipulation and JavaScript's way around the WebAPI. 

Like, I thought I was getting increasingly better at my command of this quirky programming language by my growing ability to solve [algorithmic challenges](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/codeWars/tree/master/8%20kyu){:target="_blank"}; Needless to say it ensued a humbling realisation that coding challenges and real-world web development are two beasts in and of themselves. 

That said, the development of this calculator gave me the validation that front-end development can be so immediately gratifying in its immediate feedback loop. In particular, I enjoyed working on its clean design, for which I used exclusively jinyoung.xyz's colour scheme (#AF5E59, #4E6E4E, #FAF7EF, and #575555).
