Software engineering is all about iteration upon iteration.

Looking at the git history of my latest project [CheckedIn](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/CheckedIn){:target="_blank"}, I've made over 120 commits to this exciting software I've started developing only three weeks ago. 

By the time I feel ready to make it official and share it with my network for beta testing, I wouldn't be surprised if that figure hits above 300. 

Perhaps that's because I tend to be particularly meticulous with logging every noteworthy modification on its `.git` directory. 

After all, I wouldn't want to overlook a seemingly benign iteration that may come around to cause a critical bug in an unforeseen way. 

In fact, my worst fear would manifest itself in being unable to localise what part of the script caused that bug, and consequently losing a sense of agency in the creation I've engineered. 

Today I feel moved to write about the concept of iteration because, much like computer software design, <ins>I'm convinced that a life without an astute understanding of its iterative process is one where its protagonist cannot claim full agency.</ins> 

Since writing my first `print("hello world")` seven months ago, I cannot begin to emphasise just how much my thought process has evolved over this period of time. 

While the goal I had for my sixth month mark was to apply to a competitive computer programming [retreat](https://www.recurse.com/){:target="_blank"} in NYC, I gradually came to the conclusion that jumping into such a platform at an early stage of my career is something that I would not be able to make the most out of-- as compared to participating at a later stage.

One particular [blog](https://colorfulcodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/21/recurse-center-application-process/comment-page-1/){:target="_blank"} really consolidated my rationale, and encouraged me to keep seeking for things I otherwise desire in terms of supplementing my self-guided career change. 

As I noted in my previous entry [On Direction](https://www.jinyoung.xyz/journey/2020/10/11/on-direction.html){:target="_blank"}, something I've been longing for has been the sense of peer-support that I often took for granted in my traditional schooling. 

Now, learning **any** discipline in a self-taught manner can make a lonely experience, especially without a network of colleagues with whom to bounce ideas with and remain accountable to. 

I'm convinced that these two factors are what coding bootcamps exploit from the growing number of wanna-be software developers. 

Many times I've thought about applying for a bootcamp since the email marketing I receive from some of them are just convincing enough depending on the particular mood I'm in: 

*We offer an accessible and generous Income Share Agreement (ISA) tuition model with the unique opportunity to **learn from the experts** and **accelerate** a programming career in just a few months; a feat that would otherwise be close to impossible if attempted alone.* 

*-almost all boot camps* 
<br>


Thankfully, I see myself gradually returning to the conclusion that I can achieve those two factors if I intentionally seek them out through the very kind of resourcefulness and drive that has defined my self-guided journey up until this point. 

Daniel Kahneman, a well-respected behavioural economist, talked about this deliberate, 'slow-cooked' type of thinking as performed by [System 2](https://youtu.be/PirFrDVRBo4){:target="_blank"} of your mental faculties, as opposed to its irrational counterpart-- System 1.  

Writing this entry is a conscious step towards continuing to lead a more deliberate life, and I hope that my writing will always reflect this particular life philosophy I strive to live by. 

That said, I'm pleased to share that I've found an [online community](https://groupsforlearning.com/){:target="_blank"} that has been pivotal in my pursuit of cohort-based learning and accountability systems. 

Yesterday we performed our 4th weekly standup ('standups' are a type of meeting structure that is regularly practiced in engineering teams), and I've been able to find folks to pair-program with on algorithmic challenges and also get help on debugging my code through the guidance of a mentor I met on the platform. 

While it's still early in its development, I feel propelled to share my gratitude for this community. 

It really exemplifies the notion that the internet is a wonderful place where you can always find like-minded folks who are keen on sharing the direction you're headed. 

There are only four real active members as of now, yet it feels great to have a tight-knit tribe with whom I feel a lot less lonely and lost in this often-times overwhelming endeavour. 

I'm excited to see the community grow and contribute to it in ways I can.

By the way, did I say I'm participating in my first hackathon this weekend? :)
