I've recently learned about the MVC architecture in software engineering, and I wanted to write about it to consolidate this new concept into my long-term memory. 

*Better yet, I'm hoping that someone who may read this may correct me if there are any flaws in my understanding; after all, I'm far from an expert in software design and I'm convinced it would make a great learning opportunity.* 

If there is one thing that makes software engineering particularly difficult, it would be that architecting a piece of software requires the programmer to structure their codebase in a highly organised manner. 

This type of organisation is referred to as software architecture because, much like architecture in the material world, the builder/developer needs to arrange the various components that form the 

Apart from the fact that programming, at its core, is the act of communicating one's thought process onto the computer, the ever-increasing complexity of modern software all the more requires its author to 

Organisation comes as a top priority in this discipline because, the more one's software scales across distributed systems, programming becomes less about coding and more about
