There is a pertinent quote on the internet regarding the role of self-discipline in one's endeavour: 'motivation gets you started, **yet it's discipline that keeps you going**'<sup>1</sup>.

Looking back at the beginning of my programming journey, I would say that the best learning period came about when I was quarantined from the pandemic at my childhood home in Korea and got familiar with being immersed in my own thoughts. 

Reduced in-person social interactions, freshly cemented memories of the expat life in the tropics, and the new normality of the pandemic-ridden world really allowed for deep re-evaluation of the journey I had begun post-Emory. 

Through daily walks around town and self-imposed social media detox, I had the chance to be fully present to myself and the growth that I was undergoing in my journey. 

With fondness I reminisce on those days because, truthfully, it's been tricky to remain determined since I moved back to the States a couple of months ago.

Perhaps it's because there have been a lot of intentional changes I've been bringing into my life.

Landing myself in a [co-living community](https://www.cohousing.org/directory/westwood-cohousing/){:target="_blank"} in Asheville, I've been slowly getting used to living with neighbours who greet me by my name and are keen to help one another out with ad-hoc chores<sup>2</sup>.

I've picked up a habit of attending my local YMCA on weekdays for outdoor HIIT classes,and have been on a handful of socially-distant neighbourhood walks with dates and friends in town. 

Lastly I've also been adhering to a rather measurable food budget of $30/week in an effort to regain my control of my finances.

In what can be seen as a fairly uncertain time, maybe control is what I am longing for right now. 

I believe that you should work on the things that are within your control, and hope that you are in the best shape to confront things that are perhaps out of your control (i.e. coronavirus, a bleak entry-level job market).

It is with this reason I haven't lost faith in this process; I feel pretty good about looking at life through this lens, which I think encourages more of a long-term-- rather than short-term-- approach.

In the next entry, I'll be unpacking what I mean by this long-term approach. I feel like there has been a lot of growth
