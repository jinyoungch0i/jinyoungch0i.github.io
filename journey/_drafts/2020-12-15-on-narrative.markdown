A brief exchange I had today with my neighbour Anne made me reflect on the narrative I am developing with regards to my decision to jump into a whole new career field of software engineering.

After some light catching-up, she asked me whether my work situation has been affected much by the ongoing pandemic. 

Unbeknownst to her, Anne was due to receive a rather longwinded response from me.

Starting from a summary of my former professional experience in international development, I shared with her that my current "work situation" has consisted exclusively of teaching myself computer programming in order to tackle a seemingly unrelated career in software engineering. 

A conversation like this happens quite frequently and, whenever it does, I've made it a point to repeat a few factors that determine my motivation for embarking on this endeavour. 

I feel like it's about time I wrote a few of those down onto this platform, in order to consolidate my thought process and refer back to my motive whenever I have trouble getting going with cultivating what I would consider the hardest skillset I've yet attempted to master. 

Perhaps the biggest reason I am building my skills in this new field is that I believe that programming is one of the most universally applicable skillset that one can have in this day and age.

It's a skill that can be marketed in many places around the world, and it's evidently a collaborative craft that is practiced and advocated worldwide. 

I don't believe that everyone is suited for a career in software development but the resources are absolutely there for those who are entertained by that idea, since the information is incredibly democratised.<sup>1</sup>

I like that about programming; if you have a will to take charge of your learning, you will absolutely be able to get there without having external factors<sup>2</sup> significantly weigh you down. 

In a similar vein, the opportunities for those who are good at the craft are fairly wide-reaching; despite that you are growing an expertise in a specific skillset, you can apply yourself towards a wide host of domains that are enabled by the power of information technology. 

The demand for digital transformation does not seem to slow down at any point; if anything, the pandemic was a good reminder that a lot more can be achieved virtually than one had originally thought. 

Lastly, I like that learning to program is primarily a self-guided endeavour. There is a heightened sense of agency with cultivating the in-demand skills, and 


<sup>1</sup>this point remains especially pertinent when compared to a traditional undergraduate education. however, i am not naive to dismiss the fact that the vast availability of educational resources makes it hard to find direction and structure if learning is primarily undertaken this way.







In my previous career track-- whereby I was researching the ways we, as a global society, can design a sustainable agritural trade for end markets and producers alike-- I felt like a lot of knowledge was something that was earned on the job, through the conventional standards of accumulating your Years of Experience and  which consisted of international development



Truthfully, programming has been one of the most intellectually challenging task I had given myself and I would think that it would benefit from the consolidating platform like this journal. Its also been a while since I've done freetough 

At the height of the pandemic, my previous experience at attempting a career in international development gave way into 

I decided to make this leap because I was not happy with the way I was seeing my career unfold. 



a few reasons, among which are: 1) potential for career growth (am I building skills and is my growth enabled without the sole reliance on external influence) 2) universal application and demand for type of work (a skill that enables one to communicate across continents and relate to practitioners around the globe, and (so long as you have rare and valuable skills to exchange) the demand is not ceasing anytime soon).

Despite the seemingly unrelated path that I am taking, I remind myself that the decision is deliberate and drawn from a connection to my work history.



As a matter of fact, I feel like consolidating my narrative is a pursuit that is of utmost importance right now because the lingering self-doubt and challenges of teaching myself programming is clouding my vision and creating a 

From my previous professional experience working in international development, I quickly realised that I would like to take my work on a macro-level; rather than
