# jinyoung.xyz

[jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/) is a custom-built site that is currently hosted on Netlify. It runs on Jekyll, a static site engine built in Ruby, HTML5, SASS, and CSS3. [**Link** to source code](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/xyz)

Although I had been thinking of building my first site with Python (my native language) and Flask, I came to understand that Github Pages, which had hosted [jinyoung.xyz](https://jinyoung.xyz/) at no additional cost, only supports static websites.

_*Update 11/02/20: I have now migrated the site to Netlify due to privacy concern with exposing my API key(s) in a public repository._

My initial plan was to make a full-fledged CRUD application that connects to a SQLite database, though I concluded that a static website will be a perfect starting point for now. After all, I'm not trying to make the next Facebook; I just want this to be a minimalist platform where I can share my work and growing opinion on programming and other life endeavours. 

While I'm still exploring various avenues to scale jinyoung.xyz, I am happy to have gotten to learn how to deploy a fast and responsive website that also has allowed me to flex my web development muscles (if you'll pardon the CSS pun).

Now, Jekyll came with the default [minima theme](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) though I ended up overhauling much of the existing codebase and to instead put in a hefty amount of custom HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and Liquid code. I think the personal touch speaks for itself. :)
